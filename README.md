## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 ClarityMedic AI

**Agent-Based Responsible AI Auditing System**

A black-box AI auditor that evaluates ML models for risk, reliability, and deployment readiness without needing access to model internals.

**What it does:**

- Dataset health & imbalance analysis
- Risk severity scoring
- Deployment blocking decisions
- Stakeholder-specific audit reports

**Inputs:**

```
--dataset data/heart.csv
--model models/heart.pkl
--target target
--problem "Heart Disease Prediction"
```

**Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost  
**Focus:** Responsible AI, Model Auditing, Governance

### 🫀 Heart Disease Detection System

**ML-Powered Clinical Risk Prediction Web App**

A full-stack application that predicts heart disease risk using a calibrated XGBoost classifier.

**Highlights:**

- Probability-based risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
- Preprocessing pipeline (imputation + scaling)
- ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85

**Stack:**

- Backend: Flask
- Frontend: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- ML: XGBoost, scikit-learn

### 🧠 Face Image Generator (VAE)

**Generative AI using Variational Autoencoders**

A deep-learning project that generates synthetic human face images by learning a probabilistic latent space.

**Key Concepts:**

- Encoder–Decoder CNN architecture
- Reparameterization trick
- Reconstruction + KL-divergence loss

**Dataset:** CelebA  
**Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras

### 🎓 Attendance Management System (Face Recognition)

**AI-Powered Automated Attendance Platform**

A production-style system using real-time facial recognition to automate attendance.

**Architecture:**

- Frontend: Next.js + React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- ML Service: FastAPI + DeepFace

**Features:**

- Face enrollment & embeddings
- Live camera recognition
- Attendance analytics dashboard
- JWT authentication

### 🔐 Hybrid RSA + AES Encryption System

**Secure Data Encryption with Cryptography**

A hybrid encryption system combining:

- RSA-2048 for secure key exchange
- AES-256 (CBC) for data encryption

Includes GUI (Tkinter) and CLI modes.

### 💬 MERN Stack Real-Time Chat App

**Socket.io Based Messaging Platform**

A scalable real-time chat application with authentication and online presence.

**Features:**
